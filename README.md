# Timy -- Programmable Timer Socket

<b>Timy</b> is a custom made Timer module (24Hrs) using ATTINY841 controller. Personally I'm using this for charging cellphone overnight. You can also use it for keeping lamp/heaters for specific time limit. Hardware & Software are fairly simple and self explanatory. It uses the Atmel Studio for ATTINY841 and a number of 3rd party libraries. 

Currently working on Timy_v2.

# Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to Timy development. You can contribute to the repository by doing:

* Pull requests (fixes, enhancements, new features... are very welcome)
* Documentation (I reckon I'm bad at it)
* Testing (filing issues or help resolving them, they take a lot of time and sometimes I don't have the required hardware to test them all)

And of course you can always buy me a beer, coffee, tea,... via the donation button below.
